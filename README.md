# User Authentication System

This is a simple user authentication system implemented in Python using CSV files for storing user details and databases. The system allows users to create a new username and password, verify their details, create a new database, change password, and perform other operations.

## Features

- **User authentication:** Users can create a new username and password, and verify their details before performing any operation.
- **Database creation:** Users can create a new database by providing a database name.
- **Password hashing:** User passwords are hashed using hashlib library for security.
- **Error handling:** Custom exceptions are defined for various error scenarios like incorrect password, user not found, database not selected, etc.
- **CSV file handling:** CSV files are used to store user details and database names.

## Usage

1. Import the required libraries: `csv`, `hashlib`, and `os`.
2. Create an instance of the `connect` class by providing username, password, and database name (optional).
3. Use the methods provided by the `connect` class to perform various operations like creating a new username and password, verifying details, creating a new database, changing password, etc.
4. Handle the custom exceptions as needed for error scenarios.

## Example Usage

```python
# Import required libraries
import csv
import hashlib
import os

# Create an instance of connect class
user = connect("myuser", "mypassword")

# Create a new username and password
user.CreateUsernamePassword("newuser", "newpassword")

# Verify username and password
user.VerfiyDetails("newuser", "newpassword")

# Create a new database
user.CreateDatabase("mydatabase")

# Change password
user.ChangePassword("newuser", "newpassword", "newpassword2")

# Get current user
current_user = user.CurrentUser()
print(current_user) # Output: User: newuser



Custom Exceptions

UserNotFound: Raised when a user is not found in the user details CSV file.
IncorrectPassword: Raised when an incorrect password is provided.
NouseridPassword: Raised when no username or password is provided.
DatabaseNameNotProvided: Raised when no database name is provided for creating a new database.
UseralreadyExist: Raised when a user already exists in the user details CSV file.
DatabasealreadyExist: Raised when a database with the same name already exists.
NotVerfiedUsernamePassword: Raised when username and password are not verified.
NotValidUsernameAndPassword: Raised when an invalid username or password is provided.
DatabaseNotSelected: Raised when a database is not selected before performing an operation.
SomethingWentWrong: Raised when an unexpected error occurs.
